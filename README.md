# SiBenJS `0-9`

SiBenJS is an esoteric and educational programming style based on the atomic parts of JavaScript. It uses only six different characters to write and execute code.

### Example

The following source will do an `alert("Hello World!")`:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/src/SiBenJS.php';
echo (new SiBenJs())->render('alert("Hello World!")');
?>
```

```js
(()=>{const e=a=>eval(a),o=a=>atob(a),c=a=>String.fromCharCode(a),x=a=>{var s="";for(var i in a[1]){s+=c(a[0][a[2][a[1][i]]]);}e(o(s));};x([{"0":116,"1":55,"2":48,"3":49,"4":68,"5":111,"6":104,"7":86,"8":99,"9":100,"10":119,"11":57,"12":75,"13":51,"14":77,"15":73,"16":90,"17":83,"18":47,"19":120,"20":84,"21":61,"22":81,"23":72,"24":74,"25":121,"26":89,"27":71,"28":108,"29":117,"30":113,"31":76,"32":98,"33":53,"34":54,"35":103,"36":112,"37":110,"38":87,"39":69,"40":78,"41":107,"42":67,"43":106,"44":97,"45":115,"46":56,"47":102,"48":52,"49":79,"50":80,"51":65,"52":122,"53":43,"54":109,"55":70,"56":50,"57":82,"58":118,"59":105,"60":66,"61":85,"62":114,"63":101,"64":88},{"1":11,"2":28,"3":22,"4":26,"5":12,"6":7,"7":10,"8":4,"9":8,"10":6,"11":2,"12":15,"13":16,"14":24,"15":5,"16":21,"17":25,"18":9,"19":0,"20":20,"21":27,"22":3,"23":19,"24":23,"25":17,"26":13,"27":18,"28":1},{"11":26,"28":38,"22":19,"26":28,"12":8,"7":37,"10":22,"4":5,"8":15,"6":41,"2":6,"15":28,"16":32,"24":27,"5":19,"21":58,"25":15,"9":55,"0":9,"20":58,"27":8,"3":54,"19":19,"23":41,"17":15,"13":17,"18":15,"1":36}]);})();
